# Charges and Fields simulator in python

## How to use
Everything is pretty self explanatory. You can add negative and positive charges with the buttons and also add sensors. You can view the voltage and charge at your mouse location on the side. You can toggle certain features for displaying. In order to delete a charge or sensor, you must press the delete button and click on that charge or sensor. To cancel the delete, just click on another button.

**NOTE:** *DUE TO THE FACT THAT EDITTING INDIVIDUAL PIXELS IN TKINTER IS EXTREMELY SLOW, I HAVE CHANGED THE SHOW VOLTAGE OPTION TO A BUTTON. THIS MEANS THAT THE VOLTAGE WILL NOT BE UPDATED AT EACH FRAME. PRESS THE RENDER VOLTAGE BUTTON TO CREATE A NEW RENDERING OF THE VOLTAGE FIELD. THE VOLTAGE IS ALSO RENDERED IN 10X10 BOXES TO SPEED UP THE PERFORMANCE.*
