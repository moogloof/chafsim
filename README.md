# Charges and Fields simulator in python

## Progress so far:

```
So far I have added some models for the particles and the fields. The particle is like a struct, just holding the data. The system is where all the calculation are made. I am adding a function to calculate the electric field. I have also added an elementary GUI, where particles are displayed with a white dot. I have added one white dot as a test. Later on, I plan to make the dots movable. I also plan to extend the info frame to include data about the electric field at the cursor position and much more.
